            <h2>My Woodworking Experience</h2>
        <p>I have been doing woodworking off and on in my free time for the past 4 years. This may seem like a lot of time, but between school and my job I have not been able to put in the work I feel like I need to, to become proficient. I have had the opportunity to apprentice under a master carpenter for a little over a year before we had to take a break due to his health and my school schedule. When I do spend time in the shop, I love wood turning, this is where you take a piece of wood and put it on a lathe that spins at a high RPM while you cut it down to your desired shape using specific tools. On a lathe I can make things like bowls, pens, spindles, handles, and more. My favorite thing I have made has been a handheld mirror I plan to pass down as a family heirloom one day.</p>

        <h3>My fist Time in the Shop</h3>
        <p>The first time I was able to use woodworking tools was in a class I took at Woodcraft of Chattanooga. It was at this class that I fell in love with woodworking and wanted to figure out how to make a living out of it. It was a cutting board class and all we did was cover the basics of woodworking, like how to work safely, and to plan out what you will need. Then we got to the fun stuff like using the table saw, but we also had sometimes when we were waiting for the glue to dry. It is not all glamorous, but I love it and being creative with my hands. Below is a photo of me in the shop working on one of my first big projects with my mentor. </p>
