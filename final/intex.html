                <p>This was this first in the series to be made into a movie by Disney. The Lion the Witch and the Wordrobe made $745 million at the worldwide box office. With a production buget of $180 million that is a profit of $565 million. I can see why Disney decided produce another from the series.  </p>

                <p>Riding on the success of the first movie, Disney produced the sequel Prince Caspian which hit theaters in 2008. Prince Caspian had a buget of $225 million and ended its theatrical run with $420 million worldwide leaving them with a smaller profit of $195 million. The sequel did not match the first films success, but disney still continued production on the next movie. </p>

                <p>This was the last movie in the book series Disney decided to produce in 2010 for a number of reasons. The budget for this movie was $145 million and made $415.7 million at the box office. This gave them a profit of $270.7 million which was an improvement from the previous movie but ultimately, disney decided to pause the series here.</p>
