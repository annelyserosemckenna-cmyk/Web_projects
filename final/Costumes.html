            <h2>A deeper look into the wardrobe</h2>
            <p>
                  The costumes for Disneys Chronicles of Narnia films were carefully designed to bring C. S. Lewiss magical world to life in a realistic and believable way. Costume designer Isis Mussenden led the creative vision for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and Prince Caspian (2008), blending elements from medieval clothing, ancient mythology, Victorian fashion, and World War II era styles. The Pevensie childrens costumes were inspired by 1940s British fashion to reflect their life in wartime England, while the outfits of creatures like centaurs, fauns, and satyrs were created using a combination of handmade armor, leather, fabric, and digital effects. The White Witchs dramatic icy gowns were designed with pale colors, sharp shapes, and shimmering textures to symbolize her cold, oppressive rule over Narnia. Large armies, such as the Telmarines and Narnians, required hundreds of handmade costumes, many of which were fully functional for battle scenes. Overall, the Narnia costumes played a major role in building the fantasy world, showing the differences between good and evil, royalty and soldiers, and humans and magical beings.
