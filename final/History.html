            <h2>C.S Lewis</h2>

                 C. S. Lewis, born in 1898 in Belfast, Ireland, was a scholar, writer, and professor at Oxford and later Cambridge University. He had a deep love for myths, fairy tales, and fantasy from an early age, which strongly influenced his writing. After serving in World War I, Lewis became a well-known academic and began writing books on literature, religion, and imagination. In the late 1940s, he came up with the idea for The Chronicles of Narnia after imagining a faun carrying an umbrella in a snowy forest. This image eventually led to the creation of the magical land of Narnia and the story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which was published in 1950.

                Lewis went on to write six more books in the series between 1951 and 1956. The Narnia books were inspired by a mix of Christian themes, classical mythology, and traditional fairy tales. Although originally intended for children, the books also carried deeper meanings about good versus evil, sacrifice, redemption, and hope. Over time, the series became one of the most beloved fantasy collections of all time, selling millions of copies worldwide and being translated into many languages. The Chronicles of Narnia continues to influence writers and filmmakers and was later adapted into movies, plays, TV series, and video games.
